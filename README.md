# private_venmo
Implementing a venmo-like dapp on ethereum.

Users can deposite dai into the smart contract and then transfer money between smart contract accounts privately.
Also, dai deposited in the account will be supplied to compound.finance so that users will earn interest on the dai they have deposited
in the account.

Initial set up of the repository from:

The repo is set up currently to use truffle and ganache to test the smart contracts. More details on those in the medium article.
